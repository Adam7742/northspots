This map was created for a user looking to potentially visit North Western B.C. and looking for some well known spots or hidden gems. Through this second exploratory lab, I wanted to get my focus to return to Northern BC. The data I would be using would once again be my own GeoJSON points that will show landmarks and important places I’ve visited while living up there. I used mapbox as this program was the most friendly for including my own GeoJSON data previously and I feel more proficient in it than something like Leaflet. Originally, I saw a Leaflet tutorial that included interactivity with the population density of States in the US in a choropleth map. While I wanted to do something similar with Canadian provinces, I felt that this analysis wouldn’t reflect my best interests and wouldn’t push myself to work out of the box a bit. However, before I made up my mind I did spend time converting Shapefiles provided by the Canadian Government in ArcGIS Pro into GeoJSON format. I feel comfortable using the previous style I had before as it works well with the diverse areas these landmarks occupy (e.g. some along the highway while others are in the backcountry). In the data creation process, the process had both ups and downs during the placement of points. A few of these locations aren’t officially labelled on Google Maps, which made the placement an approximation between using GeoJSON.io and Google Earth to find the correct location. However, looking back at all these places, I truly miss them and I hope in the summer I get the chance to go back to see the land and the people once again. The interactivity I wanted to add originally is a simple pop up when a user clicks the point to learn more about it. To further the user’s exploration of the data I’d lay out, I also included links to images of my points that are hosted on my Github repository. Most of these images were taken by me during the summers of 2021 and 2022 unless otherwise credited on my point description. 

I had some difficulty with how Mapbox updates/publishes my styles and tilesets. During this lab, I had to create brand new styles multiple times in order for changes to be viewable from my code. Another issue I had is that when I split up my points by types of sights to see, my code for some reason could not handle more than three different layers. To combat this, I put an additional layer over each of my points as a thin opacity yellow circle. This circle allows the user to select the point and obtain the name and description. While this was not my original intention, it could be argued that the yellow border helps the user select the symbols. The most difficult issue I had with Mapbox is my points not being displayed until zooming in at a certain extent. Upon changing devices however, it appears this issue has finally been resolved. I noticed that for the description in the pop ups, if there was a link the text would likely run off the box. I’m not sure how I’d correct this unless I possibly altered the geometry of the pop up box itself. Despite my best efforts to remove a few minor spelling mistakes, the tilesets would refuse to update on my map after republishing. Working in the near future, I may choose another library and program like Leaflet. This is primarily because I don't want to rely on another company's server when issues arise such as the ones I listed above. Working around network errors makes it a lot more difficult to troubleshoot whether it's your code breaking or the server slowing down.
